# Restaurant App

This is a simple restaurant logging app me and my partner use to keep track of restaurants we've visited.

To get this working with your own app you would need to:

* Create a Firebase project with Google Sign in and Firestore.
* Update the `firebase.ts` file with your own Firebase config object.
* Update the `firestore.rules` file with your user id's.

To run the app:

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
